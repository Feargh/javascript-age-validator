# Turn2Us Tech Challenge:

## User stories:

* As a user I want to be able to input my age to see if I am eligible for certain benefits
* As a user I want to be able to use a screen reader
* As a user I need to tab through HTML elements on screen
* As a low-vision user, I need high contrast and bigger text
* Easy to use so it's easy to understand for everyone
* Eligibility Feedback needed:
    * User needs to be rejected if ineligible (under 18)
    * User needs to be accepted if eligible (over 18)
    * User needs to be prompted if added the wrong info
* User data should be processed securely
